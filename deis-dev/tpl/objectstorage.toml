# In general, all object storage credentials must be able to read and write to
# the container or bucket they are configured to use.

# When you change values in this file, make sure to re-run `helm generate`
# on this chart.

# Valid values are:
# - filesystem: Store persistent data on ephemeral disk
# - s3: Store persistent data in AWS S3 (configure in S3 section)

# - gcs: Store persistent data in Google Cloud Storage
# - minio: Store persistent data on in-cluster Minio server
